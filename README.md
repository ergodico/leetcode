## Introduction
LeetCode is an excellent platform for practising coding and algorithm challenges. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more. In this repository, I'll share my solutions to these problems, providing explanations and code in various programming languages.

## Installation
To use the solutions in this repository, you can simply clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/pmentor/leetcode.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.

## Usage
Each problem solution is organized into its own directory, named after the problem's title or ID. Within each directory, you'll find the code files and any additional resources related to the problem. The code is provided in multiple programming languages for reference and learning purposes.

Feel free to explore the solutions, read the explanations, and experiment with the code on your machine. You can run the code with the compiler or interpreter associated with the respective language.

## Problem Structure
Each problem directory follows a standard structure:

```
|-- problem-title-or-id
    |-- problem.md        # Description of the problem and constraints
    |-- solution.py       # Python solution
    |-- solution.java     # Java solution
    |-- solution.cpp      # C++ solution
    |-- ...               # Other language solutions (if applicable)
```

The `problem.md` file contains a detailed description of the problem, input-output examples, and any constraints that you need to consider while solving the problem.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an efficient solution to a problem or want to add solutions in other programming languages, you can fork this repository, make your changes, and create a pull request.

Please ensure that your solutions pass all test cases and provide clear explanations for your code.
